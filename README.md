# ioT_restAPI
**The goal of the project:**
Showing near live data from ioT sensors



This weekend project came as a word in progress as i was playing around with my new ocylloscop
Trying to measure wave patterns out of my raspberry pi zero /w.

Those attempts led to connecting a sensor to the sbc and since i already have a sensor i might as well collect some data with it.
Since we have data, we need a db and one thing led to another and i find myself building a web_app to show this data.

The ETL ( currently) consists of two raspberry pi units 

One zero /w connected to the sensor, left abandoned outside. Running a data_collector, connected to the home wifi and using a request to connect to restAPI.

The second rpi is 4 with 4 gb serving as a samba / octoprint/ gp server at home.
Running docker containers of: mariaDB, mongoDB octoprint, nginx and python flask web_app.
This web_app/web_service is used as a restAPI to serve in/out access to the mariaDB.
Also serving the web page hosting the graph of weather data.

There are things i will change, but as it is. The system is fully operational.

Features:
* Write new data
* Read[all data/day(s) data/ between timestamps data
* Max / Min / AvG : temperature [ all data / day(s) data / between timestamps data
* Save to file, all data / between timestamps / day(s) 
* Count number of loggings 
* Draw chart of : day(s) / all data / between timestamps data / last data 
* The chart page is auto refreshing each 60 seconds.
